# Data-Sci-Indiv-Study

Study Name: Analysis and prediction the target values by data analysis methods.
<br>The document in provided PDF is written in Thai.

This is a study about basic steps to build a model for prediction.
<br>OS : Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
<br>Language : Scala 

The study has 2 parts:
<br>1. Study Part:  Following the steps from the website: http://vishnuviswanath.com/spark_lr.html
<br>Model: Logistic Regression
<br>The example in the link are from Kaggle knowledge challenge : "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) 
<br>The objective is to predict whether a passenger will survive using the given passenger information.

<br>2. Application Part: Apply code from the study part to predict a data given by the study advisor.
<br>The objective is to predict the target value from the given column: Year, Month, A, B, C. (A, B, C is unknown what they actually are).
<br>Taking 16 experiments that each one differs from the others by feature set (i.e. what columns are included in the feature) to find the best one for prediction.
<br>The dataset is in appendix.
<br>Model: Linear Regression (Cannot use Logistic Regression as the target values are not binary(0/1))

Unfortunately, during the study, I run codes line by line directly in Terminal so I didn't save the source code of this project. 
<br>If I have time, I will make a source code and upload it later.
