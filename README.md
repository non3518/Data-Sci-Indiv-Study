# Data-Sci-Indiv-Study

Study Name: Analysis and prediction the target values by data analysis methods.
The document in provided PDF is written in Thai.

This is a study about basic steps to build a model for prediction.
OS : Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
Language : Scala 

The study has 2 parts:
1. Study Part:  Following the steps from the website: http://vishnuviswanath.com/spark_lr.html
Model: Logistic Regression
The example in the link are from Kaggle knowledge challenge : "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster"
(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) 
The objective is to predict whether a passenger will survive using the given passenger information.

2. Application Part: Apply code from the study part to predict a data given by the study advisor.
The objective is to predict the target value from the given column: Year, Month, A, B, C. (A, B, C is unknown what they actually are).
Taking 16 experiments that each one differs from the others by feature set (i.e. what columns are included in the feature) to find the best one for prediction.
The dataset is in appendix.
Model: Linear Regression (Cannot use Logistic Regression as the target values are not binary(0/1))

Unfortunately, during the study, I run codes line by line directly in Terminal. 
So I didn't save the source code of this project. 
If I have time, I will make a source code and upload it later.
